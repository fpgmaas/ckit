## Quickstart

### Installation

_ckit_ can be installed by running

```shell
pip install ckit
```

To get started, run

```shell
ckit init
```

which will prompt to add a `ckit/ckit.yaml` file in the user's home directory (or the directory specified by the environment variable `CKIT_HOME`) for global commands, and/or a `ckit.yaml` file in the current directory for commands specific to the current project. 

To use _ckit_ to run any of the pre-configured commands, simply run

```
ckit
```

For details regarding the configuration files, see the [configuration](https://fpgmaas.github.io/ckit/configuration) section of the documentation.
